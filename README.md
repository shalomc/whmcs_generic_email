#WHMCS Generic email in tickets

Normally, a ticket arriving by email is assigned to a customer based on the email address of the customer or of a contact.
However, sometimes customers have several people involved in their operations, and it becomes cumbersome to maintain the list of valid contacts. 

This module will check if a ticket is assigned to a customer account, and if not - will assign the ticket based on the email domain.
